# Procedural World Generation

This project is a way for me to experiment with procedurally generated terrains. I used perlin noise as implemented by the p5.js library. The rendering of the terrain can probably be made more efficient by grouping adjacent tiles of the same type and rendering them as one shape.

This project will lay the foundation for a web-based game I am working on. So stay tuned! :D
